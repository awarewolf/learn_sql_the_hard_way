-- SQL is mostly a case-insensitive language. It was created in an era when case sensitivity was perceived as a major usability problem, so it has this quirk which can anoy the hell out of programmers from other languages. Rewrite this so that it's all lowercase and see if it still works. You'll need to delete ex1.db.

-- It works!
